# Excercise Tracker

## MongoDB, ExpressJs, AngularJS with Regirstration, Login with Proper Validation and User Exercise Activity Track

## MongoDB

Start mongodb server in mongoshell is the very first step.

## Installation

 npm install 

## Run 

 npm start // run on port 8080

 ng serve //run on port 4200
 
### Angular is running in angular-src folder in my project

## Basic Flow

First I have created User Schema in models/user.js using mangoose. In Back End I have used ExpressJS. I have created register, login, dashboard, home, profile components. First User do registration. After that username and password being stored in collection. Here password is also encrypted. I have learned passport, bcryptjs and jsonwebtoken by been through some videos and I implemented this in my project to provide password encryption and authorization of user. I have provided proper validation to register and login. Once User can login then and then he can track his exercise activities. He input the walk steps(number), run(miles), swim(hours) and sleep(hours) and Dashboard page display user's walksteps, run, swim, sleep per day using beautiful progress-circle css styling. 

So in this project I have impletemented three things properly and looks elegant. Register, Login and Dashboard to display user Exercise  Track. I have implement login bothh way you taught us in class and I also implement login using MongoDB database. I want to learn how to use database in angular project so in my project I did using database. But in practise I went through the approach you taught us in class. Last day when I came to meet you, I was working on that login functionality. Once I got success in that I have started to implement login using database. And I got success in both approach. 

I believe I learned lot concepts of angular and front end and how to use api, nodejs, expressjs. I have never worked with front end before but I learned lot of things in class. I am graduating this May'2018 and I believe I had a best decision to take your course so that I have some skills in web server programming as well now. Thanks!
