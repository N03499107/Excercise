After that username and password being stored in collection. Here password is also encrypted. I have provided proper validation to register and login. Once User can login than and than he can track his exercise activities. He input the walk steps(number), run(miles), swim(hours) and sleep(hours) and Dashboard page display user's walksteps, run, swim, sleep per day using beautiful progress-circle css styling.
